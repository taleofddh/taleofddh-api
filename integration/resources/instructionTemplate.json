If things are not as straightforward as we assume then there may be additional costs which we will always explain to you and want to agree with you as soon as we become aware of them. Should we find any unexpected issues during the case, we will explain and discuss these with you in writing as soon as possible and agree any additional fees with you before we carry out the work. We want to avoid any surprises when you receive our bill at the end of your case which is why it is important for you to let us know as much information about your case as you can at the beginning.</div>\n                <div style=\"padding: 5px; text-align: left; font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;\">For Leasehold properties the landlord is likely to charge a registration fee. This fee is not included within the quote as it is charged at the landlord's discretion and cannot be known without first contacting the landlord. We will advise you of these costs during your case and in writing as soon as we become aware of them.</div>\n                <div style=\"padding: 5px; text-align: left; font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;\">Our Legal Fee is only payable if your case completes.

    "TextPart": "Dear {{supplierQuote.supplier.name}},\n\nWe are delighted to inform you that {{customerName}} has reviewed {{service}} quotations from ServEase and wish to instruct your firm for their {{service}} requirements.\n\nKindly contact the client to complete the instruction and on-boarding process.\n\nClient details\nName: {{customerName}}\nEmail: {{customerEmail}}\nInstructions: {{customerInstruction}}\n\n{{service}} requirements are listed below\n| Question | Response |\n{{#each responseList}}\n    {{#if hidden}}\n    {{else}}\n        | {{question}} | {{choice}} |\n    {{/if}}\n{{/each}}\n    \nIf you would like to change any of the responses, please resubmit details for amended quotes.\n\n{{service}} partner\n{{supplierQuote.supplier.name}}\n{{supplierQuote.supplier.shortDescription}}\n\n{{service}} cost details\nLegal Fee: £ {{supplierQuote.legalFeeTotal}}\nBase Amount: £ {{supplierQuote.legalFee.baseFee}}\nTax Amount: £ {{supplierQuote.legalFee.taxAmount}}\nDisbursments: £ {{supplierQuote.disbursementsTotal}}\n{{#each disbursementList}}\n| {{type}} | £ {{baseFee}} |\n{{/each}}\nTax Amount: £ {{supplierQuote.disbursementsTax}}\nAdditional Fee: £ {{supplierQuote.additionalFeeTotal}}\n{{#each additionalFeeList}}\n| {{type}} | £ {{baseFee}} |\n{{/each}}\nTax Amount: £ {{supplierQuote.additionalFeeTax}}\n\nTotal: {{supplierQuote.totalFee}}\n\nStamp Duty: £ {{supplierQuote.stampDutyTotal}}\nLand Registration: £ {{supplierQuote.landRegistrationTotal}}\n\nWhat is included in our Legal Fees?\nIn our legal service we include electronic ID checks, bank transfer fees, acting for a lender, completing a Stamp Duty Land Tax Return, Local Search, Drainage Search, Environmental Search, Mining Search (if applicable) and Land Registry (Bankruptcy and Priority) Searches. We think it's much easier to have them all in one fee.\n\nWhat do we assume when calculating our Legal Fees?\nTo be able to offer simple pricing, we have to make some assumptions and these are that your case is a straightforward purchase. If things are not as straightforward as we assume then there may be additional costs which we will always explain to you and want to agree with you as soon as we become aware of them. Should we find any unexpected issues during the case, we will explain and discuss these with you in writing as soon as possible and agree any additional fees with you before we carry out the work. We want to avoid any surprises when you receive our bill at the end of your case which is why it is important for you to let us know as much information about your case as you can at the beginning.\nFor Leasehold properties the landlord is likely to charge a registration fee. This fee is not included within the quote as it is charged at the landlord's discretion and cannot be known without first contacting the landlord. We will advise you of these costs during your case and in writing as soon as we become aware of them.\nOur Legal Fee is only payable if your case completes. If additional work is identified during your case as outlined above then this is not included in our no completion, no fee arrangement.\n\nKind regards,\nServEase Team\n\nThe contents of this email message and any attachments are intended solely for the addressee(s) and may contain confidential and/or privileged information and maybe legally protected from disclosure.
